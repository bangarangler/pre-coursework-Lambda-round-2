# pre-coursework-Lambda-round-2
Going over the pre course work again for further clarification.

this is purly a second round through the pre-course material that was all done on repl.it.
there is no live instruction.  I'm just digging through pre recorded videos and trying to piece it together.

genrally not a problem.  Although certain lessons really require some digging through google trying to find some missing links.

no need for anyone to look at this.  It's just for me to solidify my knowledge base and help better determine what I need to improve on .
